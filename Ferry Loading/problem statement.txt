One more time with Dynamic Programming! The code for this should be similar to check cashing. If you really understand check cashing, you should be able to figure out how to do this one too!

You are running a ferry that can carry cars across a river. The ferry has two lanes (left and right), and there is a line of cars that want to get onto the ferry. You know the length of the ferry, the number of cars, and the length of each car. Put as many cars as you can onto the ferry, directing each one (in order) onto either the left or right side.

You must keep the cars in order. You cannot change the order, or skip any cars. Get the maximum number of cars on, and print out which side you put them onto.

Here are some sample input files, and appropriate answers. The output should print the number of cars that were successfully put onto the ferry, and either left or right for each of them (use either L or R). Note that there is a "mirror image" for each possible answer, so there's not just one possible output for each input.

ferry2.txt and an answer ferry2-out.txt
ferry3.txt and an answer ferry3-out.txt
ferry4.txt and an answer ferry4-out.txt
